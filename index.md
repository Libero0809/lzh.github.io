### Welcome to My Home Page!

I am Ziheng Liu, a Ph.D. student at Kahlert School of Computing, the University of Utah, starting from 2022.![](me.jpg)

### My Research

I am advised by Professor [<em>Yin Yang</em>](https://yangzzzy.github.io/).
My current research topic is physics-based simulation and motion capture.

#### Current Project

- Motion capture system following paper: He Chen, Hyojoon Park, Kutay Macit, and Ladislav Kavan. 2021. [<em>Capturing detailed deformations of moving human bodies.</em>](https://doi.org/10.1145/3450626.3459792) ACM Trans. Graph. 40, 4, Article 85 (August 2021), 18 pages.

#### Past Project

- A physics-based simulation framework for elastic bodies.
